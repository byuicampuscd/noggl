# noggl
update a github file with toggl reports

### Installing
###### Clone this repository with
```
git clone https://github.com/byuicampuscd/noggl.git
```
*It is important that the folder you install this to has been initallized with git (`git clone` will do this automatically)
and that you have permissions to push to the repository, because the github file will be just updated just with `git add` `get push` etc.*

###### Install the npm dependencies
```
npm install -g
```

###### Then run :)
```
node noggl
```
The first time you run it, it will ask for your toggl API key. Which can be found in your profile settings on toggl's site


*// I think this is what we want we just need to add in typing in the password everytime*
